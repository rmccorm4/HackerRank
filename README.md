# Binghamton-ACM

## February 2017 Competition
I placed 3rd in a programming competition organized by my Binghamton University's ACM chapter.
This repository has the problems and solutions that I solved.

During this competition I learned on the fly how to use regular expressions in Python and implemented it which was exciting.
